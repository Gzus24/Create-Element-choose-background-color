# Create-Element-choose-background-color
for this project i decided to make a background picker app just using document.createElement.
When deciding to do this project i wanted to learn how to create elements using javascript only. along the way i learned how to use 
appendChild and got better at using event listeners as well. the background picker was my first project and easiest out of my projects to learn how to use
createElement.
